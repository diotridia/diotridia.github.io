                We know that Todoroki has a very high resistance to his own Quirk. However, we don’t know if that means he’s immune to boiling water, other fire quirks etc.</li>

            <li>Todorki’s hero costume is the only student so far in class 1-A to have undergone lots of changes – having essentially only kept his boots from his first costume. His new costume has a utility belt which houses metal canisters container pain medication, disinfectants, water – acting as first-aid supply.</li>
